        <p>I am very strong at core technologies, frameworks, and languages. I can work on relatively complex projects/tasks with relative ease. The projects I deliver mostly involve very sophisticated security elements, the highest level of user interactivity, and huge performance benefits. I've been a programmer for around two decades and have a lot of experience to bring to the table. I have a Bachelors's in computer science.
